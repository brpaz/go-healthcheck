## üéØ Features

- Built-in Healthchecks that covers the monitoring of the most common use cases, like databases, HTTP endpoints, Redis, Disk space, and more. Check the [list of available checks](https://brpaz.github.io/go-healthcheck/checks/).
- Built-in HTTP handler compatible with the native `http` package that constructs the Healthcheck endpoint following the [RFC Healthcheck](https://inadarei.github.io/rfc-healthcheck/) specification.
- Implement your own custom Healthchecks easily by implementing a simple interface.
- No external dependencies.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/brpaz/go-healthcheck/v2
```

### Basic Usage

To use the library, simply create a new instance of the Healthcheck service, add your desired checks, and expose the healthcheck endpoint using the provided HTTP handler.

```go
package main

import (
  "net/http"

  "github.com/brpaz/go-healthcheck/v2"
  "github.com/brpaz/go-healthcheck/v2/checks/mockcheck"
)

func main() {
  // Create your healthchecks.
  check1 := mockcheck.New(
      mockcheck.WithName("my-check"),
      mockcheck.WithStatus(checks.StatusPass),
  )

  hc := healthcheck.New(
    healthcheck.WithServiceID("my-service"),
    healthcheck.WithDescription("My Service"),
    healthcheck.WithVersion("1.0.0"),
    healthcheck.WithReleaseID("1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"),
    healthcheck.WithChecks(mycheck),
  )

  http.HandleFunc("/health", healthcheck.HealthHandler(hc))
  http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```
