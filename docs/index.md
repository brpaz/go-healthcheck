# Introduction

Go Healthcheck is a Golang library to add Healthchecks to your application.

It follows closely the [RFC Healthcheck](https://inadarei.github.io/rfc-healthcheck/) for the structure of the health check response.

This library provides several built-in checks. Please refer to the [checks documentation](./checks/index.md#built-in-checks) for more details.

# Usage

See the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide for instructions on how to use the library.
